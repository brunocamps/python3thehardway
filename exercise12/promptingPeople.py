#For input you can also put in a prompt to show to a person so he knows what to type.
#Put a string that you want for the prompt inside the () so that it looks like this:

y = input("Name? ")

#You can completely rewrite the previous exercise using just input to do all the
#prompting.

age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you?")
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")

print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy!")
